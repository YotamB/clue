#Clue open issues November 11, 2012:

1. MVC- need to do better separation:
 	- move most functions from Model -> Control , Model need to mostly contain the data and manipulate it not run 
 		functions that are game flow related. 
 	- View will get a board with all the data and will know how to print it, .
 
2. View - Have a lot of work on the View, need to get a board from the Controller ant print it.
		- exceptions!!, add input testing.
